# Welcome to Akeru Search! 👋

I've built an open-source search engine that combines traditional search with AI-powered insights, similar to what you might have seen with Perplexity AI. I'm primarily using [Groq's](https://groq.com/) lightning-fast LLM infrastructure, though I've made it flexible enough to work with other AI providers too.

## What's Under the Hood? 🛠️

I've chosen some of my favorite modern tools to build this:

- **Next.js 15** - The latest and greatest for blazing fast performance
- **React & TypeScript** - Keeping things smooth and bug-free
- **Tailwind CSS** - For that slick, modern look
- **Framer Motion** - Adding some delightful animations
- **Radix UI** - Making sure everyone can use it easily
- **Vercel OG** - Your search results will look great when shared!

For the AI magic, I'm mainly using Groq because it's super fast, but I've also made it work with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and others for testing. You can even add your own favorite AI provider if you want!

## Search That Respects Your Privacy 🔒

I'm using Brave Search by default, but I've also integrated with [GaiaNet](https://www.gaianet.ai/) if you want extra privacy (they don't log your searches). You get:

- Smart AI-powered results
- Real-time processing
- Private searching (with GaiaNet)
- Rich results combining search and AI summaries

## What's Next? 🎯

Honestly? Not much! I built this mostly for fun and to show off some UI tricks I've learned. 😄 I might add some investment analysis features, image search and other fun stuff.

## Want to Help? 🤝

I'd love to have you join in! Before you start coding though, you'll need some API keys. Just reach out to me (@guibibeau) and I'll help you get set up with:

- Groq API key (or any other inference provider)
- Brave Search
- Any other AI provider keys you want to play with

Once you've got your keys, just fire up the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
