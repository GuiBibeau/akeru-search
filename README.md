## Features and Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14**: Utilizing the latest features of Next.js for optimal performance and developer experience.
- **React**: Building interactive UI components with React.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and improved developer productivity.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapidly styling the application with utility-first CSS.
- **Framer Motion**: Creating smooth animations for an enhanced user experience.
- **Radix UI**: Leveraging accessible and customizable UI components.
- **Vercel OG**: Generating dynamic Open Graph images for better social media sharing.

## Powered by GaiaNet Node and Brave Search

Akeru Search is built on a custom API powered by a [GaiaNet](https://www.gaianet.ai/) node and utilizes Brave Search. This integration allows for:

- Decentralized AI-driven search results
- Real-time data processing and retrieval
- Enhanced privacy and data ownership for users
- Comprehensive search results combining Brave Search with GaiaNet's summarization capabilities

## Future Goals

Our vision for Akeru Search extends beyond its current capabilities:

1. **Open Source Agents Protocol**: We aim to develop an open-source protocol that acts as a Layer 2 solution for decentralized AI protocols, inspired by [GaiaNet's](https://www.gaianet.ai/) approach to living knowledge systems.
2. **Expanded AI Capabilities**: Integrating more advanced AI models and techniques to improve search accuracy and relevance, leveraging GaiaNet's continuous adaptation and growth principles.
3. **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Further decentralizing our infrastructure to enhance reliability and reduce single points of failure, aligning with GaiaNet's decentralized platform model.
4. **Community-Driven Development**: Encouraging community contributions to shape the future of decentralized search technology, similar to GaiaNet's collaborative environment for sharing knowledge and innovation.
